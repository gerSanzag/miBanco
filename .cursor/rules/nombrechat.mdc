Use the date command to get the current system date and time in YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS format. Then, name this chat using the following pattern:

[autoincrement_number]-[date_time]-[short_descriptive_name]
	•	autoincrement_number: a numeric prefix that increments based on the last created chat.
	•	date_time: the current system timestamp.
    •	Use a format for the date, like: dd/mm/YYYY and for the time like: HH:MM:SS.
	•	short_descriptive_name: a brief, meaningful summary of the chat content.
